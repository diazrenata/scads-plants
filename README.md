# scads-plants

Analysis of Portal plant community species abundance distributions as compared to their feasible set. This is a development sandbox for a method to apply to large datasets.

Generally speaking, the functions in this repository are utilities to 1) load specifically the Portal Project plant data, 2) source analytical methods, mostly from `diazrenata/scads`, and 3) provide wrappers for an analysis at scale using drake. Active work on the actual metrics and analytical methods should stay in `diazrenata/scads`.
