Skewness is not entirely unique to an element of the FS, but you don't get re-used skews until you have extremely small feasible sets.

2009 is problematic because the communities are very small (S = 1 and 3, N = 2 and 5 respectively). Similarly, winter of 2000 had 12 individuals of 2 species. Notably, winter 1996 had 34 individuals of 3 species, and this appears to be enough to get some interesting variation going.

So far, this result contrasts with what I was finding earlier. Skewness is not always an incredible outlier. I am going to do this with the 1994 data to confirm that I haven't messed up somewhere.

If this holds (and perhaps even if it doesn't) perhaps it's worth re-investigating Legendre approximation over a broader set of datasets. It looks like the ones I pulled might have been unusual.
